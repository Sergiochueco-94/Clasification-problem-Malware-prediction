# Clasification-problem-Malware-prediction

In this project, you can see a classification problem when I used different algorithms to create a better model.

1. Data Understanding.
2. Insights.
3. Data Cleaning.
4. Data Preparation.
5. Data Preprocessing.
6. Modelling.
7. Instantiate the model
8. Fit model.
9. Evaluation model.

In the end, compare all models to pick the best one.

If you are here, you can see the data used for this project and the code.
