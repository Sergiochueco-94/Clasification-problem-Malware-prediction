In this project, you can see a classification problem when I used different algorithms to create a better model.
I try to detect a possible malware.

### 1. Data Understanding:
   
   I create different keys for understanding data and the problem.

### 2. Insights:
   
   I get insights to understand the business problem and which variables can help to the algorithms predict better. 

### 3. Data Cleaning:
   In this step, drop some columns because it's self explanatory or little explanatory. Also, there were a lot of labels and I consider grouping for reducing them so that      the model learns better
   
### 4. Data Preparation:
   
   Transform different data and One Hot Encoding for categorical labels. The algorithms need all numerical labels.

### 5. Modelling:
   
   Continue to decide which algorithm use to create us model. In this case, I use different for compare after. XGBoostregressor, Decision Tree and Random Forest                Regressor.

### 6. Instantiate the model:
   
   Indicate to the algorithms the parameters and fit it.
   
### 7. Evaluation model:
    
   In the end, need an evaluation model for deciding how well it does it. I use some parameters: AUC, Accuracy, ROC Curve, F1 Score and Confusi√≥n matrix. All of them help      us to decide the best model for the problem.
